# youtube-video-chat-llm-app

This is a Shiny for Python app that fetches a Youtube video transcript and provides a LLM chat interface around it. It uses the [OpenAI API](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) for the LLM and [youtube-transcript-api](https://pypi.org/project/youtube-transcript-api/) package to get the Youtube video transcripts.

## Setup

The app expects that you have an OpenAI API key that you can paste into the input box. You can get one by visting the OpenAI API [quickstart page](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart/).

## Accessing the app

You can clone this repo and run the app locally or access the app via [Connect Cloud](https://connect.posit.cloud/) at the website link in the repository details (under "About"). You may need to create a Connect Cloud account to access the app.
